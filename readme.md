Welcome and thanks for reading the about me.

I choose to make an iOS app with Swift because I believe that Swift will have a major impact on the way we code our next generation applications. It is something fresh and therefore importent to try out.

I came with the Idea to make a Corona (COVID-19) Virus Tracker because I always want to be up to date with the latest information about the spread of Corona. In the past I had to check multiple websites to keep up to date and hope that they already released new information. This alway took some time. Thats why I build an app for it, now I can open the app and directly see the latest information.

In order to have the latest information I used the following resources.

- Statistics: ArcGIS Corona Virus Dataset / Esri Propiertary
- Advice: World Health Organisation

I hope this app helps people keeping up to date with the current situation.

Hi my name is Robin Nap and thanks for taking the time to review my final project.

For my final project I choose to make a Corona Virus Tracker app. For this project I choose Swift as my coding language because I believe Swift will have a major impact on the way we code our next generation applications. It is something fresh and therefore important to check out.

I came with the Idea to make a Corona Virus Tracker because I always want to be up to date with the latest information about the spread of Corona. In the past I had to check multiple websites to keep up to date and hope that they already had released new information. This alway took some time. Thats why I build an app for it, now I can open de app and directly see the latest information.

Let me walk you through.

- When you launch the app the latest information will automatically be fetched from ArcGIS and Esri Propietrary. And we will see a overview of the current confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, sicks, fatality rate and recovery rate from over the whole world. Below you can see the results for each specific country. You are also able to search for a country.

- In the maps section you can see a map with all the statistics of each country.

- On the advices you can see what you could do to help prevent Covid-19 from spreading. This information is kept up to date with the World Health organisation advise json

- As last we have the about page where you could find all the resources and copyrights.

I hope this gives a clear overview about my final project. I also hope this project will impact our community.
